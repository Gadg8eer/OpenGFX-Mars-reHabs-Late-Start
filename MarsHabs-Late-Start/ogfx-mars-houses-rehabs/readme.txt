This NewGRF provides Houses originally made by Zephyris. Originally meant for the Martian Environment, but can be used in any climate including landscape GRFs such as JP+ and AuzLandscape. 

Name of this Repo:  reHabs - OpenGFX Mars Houses: Late Start
Repository version: 11

Just add the NewGRF to the selection of active NewGRFs within the
configuration window as accessible from the main menu.

Note that OpenGFX Mars itself has alignment issues (fixed in this mod) that means using these or any other GRFs (except the original OpenGFX Mars Habitats and most of its' successor mods) with OpenGFX Mars will lead to graphical glitches caused by OpenGFX Mars, in spite of looking like they should work together.

Using this GRF with any GRFs not directly related to OpenGFX Mars should work just fine, but let Gadg8eer know if anything goes wrong and he'll fix it.
